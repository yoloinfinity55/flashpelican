This is a practical, step-by-step guide for installing and setting up the static site generator Pelican on a Mac mini with an M1 (Apple Silicon) chip.

Pelican is a Python-based tool, so the first steps focus on establishing a clean Python environment.

üíª Part 1: Initial M1 Setup (Python & Virtual Environment)

A virtual environment is highly recommended for all Python projects. It isolates the dependencies for Pelican from other Python projects and your system's Python installation.

Step 1: Install Python (if not already installed)

While macOS comes with a version of Python, it's best practice for development to install the official version.

Download the Official Installer: Go to the official Python website's downloads page and look for the latest stable version for macOS. The installer will automatically be an Apple Silicon (arm64) build, which is natively optimized for your M1 chip.

Run the Installer: Double-click the downloaded .pkg file and follow the on-screen prompts.

Verify the Installation: Open your Terminal application (Spotlight search: <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd>, type "Terminal").

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
python3 --version
# Expected output: Python 3.x.x (where x.x is the version you installed)
Step 2: Create Your Project Directory

Choose a location for your Pelican site and create a new folder.

In your Terminal, navigate to your desired location (e.g., a projects folder in your home directory) and create a new project folder named my-pelican-site.

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
mkdir -p ~/projects/my-pelican-site
cd ~/projects/my-pelican-site
Step 3: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

Use Python's built-in venv module to create an isolated environment in your new project folder.

Create the Virtual Environment:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
python3 -m venv .venv

This command creates a new folder named .venv inside your project directory.

Activate the Virtual Environment:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
source .venv/bin/activate

Your Terminal prompt should now change to start with (.venv), indicating the environment is active. All packages you install now will only affect this project.

üì¶ Part 2: Pelican Installation and Quickstart

With the Python environment ready, you can now install Pelican and generate your site.

Step 4: Install Pelican

Use the Python package installer (pip) to install Pelican and the Markdown parser (which is recommended for writing content).

Install Pelican:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
python -m pip install "pelican[markdown]"
Step 5: Run the Quickstart Script

Pelican comes with a quickstart utility to set up the basic structure and configuration.

Run the Quickstart:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
pelican-quickstart

Answer the Questions: The script will ask you a series of questions.

For questions with a default value in brackets (e.g., [my blog]), you can press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to accept it.

You will be asked for your URL prefix. This is important. If you plan to deploy your site to a domain like https://www.example.com, enter that here. For now, you can press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to leave it blank, or enter a placeholder.

Do you want to generate a Makefile? (Y/n): Y (Recommended for easier running).

Do you want to generate a Rakefile? (Y/n): n (Unless you use Ruby Rake).

‚úçÔ∏è Part 3: Create Content and Preview
Step 6: Create Your First Article

Pelican content is typically written in Markdown or reStructuredText. The quickstart created a content folder.

Create a New File: Use your preferred text editor (like VS Code, Sublime Text, or nano in the terminal) to create a new file named first-post.md inside the content folder.

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
# You can use the terminal editor `nano`
nano content/first-post.md

Add Content: Paste the following basic structure, which includes required metadata:

code
Markdown
download
content_copy
expand_less
Title: Hello World of Pelican

This is my first post created with Pelican on my M1 Mac mini!
It's super easy to get started once Python and venv are set up.

Save the File: If you used nano, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>, then <kbd>Enter</kbd>, then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>.

Step 7: Generate Your Static Site

This step compiles your content into the final HTML/CSS/JS files.

Generate the Site:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
pelican content

The generated files will be placed in the newly created output/ directory.

Step 8: Preview Your Site Locally

Use Pelican's built-in web server to view your site in a browser.

Serve the Site:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
pelican --listen
# OR, if you chose to generate a Makefile:
make serve

View in Browser: Open your web browser and navigate to:

code
Code
download
content_copy
expand_less
http://localhost:8000/

You should now see your Pelican site with your new "Hello World of Pelican" post!

Final Step: Deactivate Environment

When you are done working, you should deactivate the virtual environment.

Deactivate:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
deactivate

Your Terminal prompt will return to normal.

To resume work later, just navigate back to your project folder (cd ~/projects/my-pelican-site) and run source .venv/bin/activate again.
